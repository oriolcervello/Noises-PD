# Noise Externals for Pure Data


Here you will find externals of Noise for Pure Data. To use it just unzip the folder of the external in your externals directory of pure data.


white_noise~ : generates a signal of white noise. Left output.


pink_noise~ : generates a signal of pink noise. Left output.


lp1_noise~ : generates a low pass filtered noise of 1rst order (decay of 20dB/decade) at the selected cut Freq


lp2_noise~ : generates a low pass filtered noise of 2rst order (decay of 40dB/decade) at the selected cut Freq


lp3_noise~ : generates a low pass filtered noise of 3rst order (decay of 60dB/decade) at the selected cut Freq


lp1_noise : generates a low pass filtered noise of 1rst order (decay of 20dB/decade) at the selected cut Freq in an interface mode
